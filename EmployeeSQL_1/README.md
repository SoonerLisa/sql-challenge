# sql-challenge for Challenge Module 9 SQL

Before beginning:
-A new repository was created, "sql-challenge".
-REPO sql-challenge was cloned to my PC.
-A folder "EmployeeSQL_1" was created in REPO sql-challenge. All files for this challenge reside within folder 'EmployeeSQL_1' then pushed to GitHub.

This challenge is 3-part.

Part 1: Data Modeling
*Created sketch of ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) using all 6 .csv files provided in Starter_Code.
*Included 2 .png screen shots of ERD created with QuickDBD as well as a .pdf text documentation.
*PageAdmin 4 was used to sketch ERD as well. A screenshot is included since the file is only easily opened with pageAdmin. ERD_Sketch-Data_Modeling.pgerd

Part 2: Data Engineering
*Table schema were created for each of the 6 .csv files. 
*All data were properly typed, keyed, and constrained where needed. 
*A composite key was necessary of 3 .csv tables to insist each row are uniquely identified. (departments, dep_emp, dep_manager) 

Part 3: Data Analysis
*Lists (Conclusions) were created for all 8 questions and saved as DataAnalyticsAssignment-Part3_Module9.sql
*Each list is numbered from Q1-Q8.
